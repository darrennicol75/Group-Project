# Group-Project

Overview:  -

The aim of this project was to develop a carbon footprint tracker with a full stack application. 

This included using Javascript HTML CSS Vue and MongoDB. 

The Brief was as follows: - 

You have been approached by a lifestyle consultancy company dealing with environmental sustainability. Your task is to build a personal CO2 footprint checker app that calculates a user's CO2 footprint based on their lifestyle.

MVP
A user should be able to:

- To submit values for various aspects of their lifestyle (e.g. diet, commute, recycling and heating routine, holiday habits, etc) and view their CO2 footprint. You'll need to create your own (simple) tested model to calculate this.
- To update the values to see the effect on their CO2 footprint.
view the CO2 footprint result in a visually interesting ways.

Team: - 

Group Project undertaken with codeclan colleagues Jonny and Marcin. 

Great team that I really enjoyed working with, I focused on back end, Marcin on routes and Jonny front end. 
The project started with planning with user stories, user journeys and wire frames. 
To track the project we used a trello board with to do, doing and done lanes which worked well as we were working remotely
over the weekend. 

Result: - 

We achieved MVP that calculated an individual score and added an extension of ranking them on a leader board. We also added the ability to offer tips for lowering their score given their input such as suggestion of using public transport. 

Installation: - 

cd server

npm i

mongod

npm run server:dev

cd ..

cd client

npm i

npm run serve

Future Extensions/ Bugs: - 

There is a refresh bug so each time page is refreshed it losses users details

The leaderboard bug puts the lowest scoring individual at the base of the chart

An original extension was also to offset a carbon score by adding the ability or at least the calculation and location
of carbon credits but it was deemed as a nice to have and we ran out of time.
